#Today I hope everyone:
* Learns about the open data landscape in DC. 
* Gains familiarity with R
* Builds a foundation of data analysis and visualization in R
* Learns about DC through open data!

###This presentation and the data we're using can be found here:

#Who Am I?
![](images/DSC_0076.jpg)

### Oh, hi, I'm Kate. 
I like to analyze and visualize data about the District for my website, [DataLensDC](http://www.datalensdc.com/). My work's been featured on CityLab, GGWash, Washingtonian, and Washington City Paper, among others. I'm the Data Lead for [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org/), a civic hacking organization you should all join! 

I'm also a co-organizer of this year's [Tech Lady Hackathon](http://techladyhackathon.org/), a one day *free* hackathon and learning workshop for women. 

During the day, I'm an Economist for the U.S. government. 

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DataLensDC) at @datalensdc or by e-mail at datalensdc@gmail.com.

#DC's Open Data
### There is a lot of data about DC publicly available through the federal or city government. 
The most comprehensive sites are:

* For federal-level data: [data.gov](https://www.data.gov/)

* For city-level data: [opendata.dc.gov](http://opendata.dc.gov/)

But these are by no means exhuastive!

Open data is hidden throughout the web. I've created a DC-specific list of data [here](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/ManyHomesofDCData). Keep an eye out for a new open data website from Code for DC which aims to be an exhaustive repository. 

### There is also a lot of data not publicly available. 
If there is data you are interested and think the government has it, FOIA for it. This is not as daunting as it may seem. Here's [my FOIA guide.](https://github.com/katerabinowitz/FOIA-Requests). 

### Here are some cool things made with open data:

* All my [DataLensDC](http://www.datalensdc.com/) blog posts.
* [Home Fire Risk Map](http://www.datakind.org/blog/american-red-cross-and-datakind-team-up-to-prevent-home-fire-deaths-and-injuries), created by [DataKindDC](http://www.meetup.com/DataKind-DC/)
* [Per-Student Funding](http://dcpsbudget.ourdcschools.org/), created by [Code for DC](http://codefordc.org/)
* [Tons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/local/metro-history-failures/) [and](http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/news/article/20782284/charts-in-dc-elections-majority-doesnt-rule) [tons](http://mobilitylab.org/2016/09/09/waba-regional-bike-lane-map/) [of](http://www.urban.org/features/our-changing-city-collection) [news](https://districtmeasured.com/2016/08/23/d-c-s-cashiers-and-janitors-are-more-likely-to-live-in-the-city-than-other-workers-but-thats-changing/) [stories](https://wamu.org/news/16/07/13/permitting_problems_do_you_know_who_s_working_on_your_house_in_dc_it_s_not_clear) [and](http://time.com/4347614/washington-dc-metro-worst-stations/) [visualizations](http://open.dc.gov/econintel-cotw/).

#Let's Get Programming!
## But before that...
There's a lot to learn with R and we couldn't possibly cover it all in two hours! But I do hope everyone leaves feeling comfortable and excited about programming in R. There a number of great free, online resources for continuing your R learning after today:

* [Cookbook for R by Winston Chang](http://www.cookbook-r.com/) Guide to common tasks and problems in R
* [Advanced R by Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) Don't let the 'Advanced' scare you!
* [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/how-to-learn-r-2/) The most popular blog about R
* [R Cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) Cheatsheets for RStudio, data visualization, wrangling, and more!
* [Swirl](http://swirlstats.com/) An interactive way to learn R, in R
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) All the questions and answers!

#RStudio
<center>![](images/RStudioEnv.png)</center>

###R Studio is the primary working environment for R programming and it's split into four different panels. 
* __The bottom left is the Console__. Code entered here immediately executes and can't be saved to file. Let's try a few simple match equations in the Console!
* __The top left panel has tabs for R files and Data.__ Here you can create, edit, and view R files that hold your code. You can also view your data. 
* __The top right panel has tabs for the Environment and History__. The environment tab is a list of the (mostly) data you have loaded for your session. The history tab shows your history of R coding. Whether or not it was saved to a file! History is also searchable. 
* __The bottom right panel includes the Help and Plots tabs.__ Help holds descriptions and examples for R functions. Plots displays the graphics you've created. Other tabs show files and packages.

#Some of R's best features don't come pre-loaded. 
R is open source. There is base functionality that comes standard with R, but many of the best features in R come through packages. Packages are created by users and contain data or functions to address a given task in R. To use a package it must first be installed on your computer. Then you need the load the package once per session. 

###Today we're going to be using two packages:

* __dplyr__ for manipulating data
* __ggplot2__ for visualizing data

###Let's get those packages!
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(dplyr) #installs package to your computer
require(dplyr) #loads package to session

install.packages(ggplot2)
require(ggplot2) 
```

#A few things to always keep in mind with R

* R is always case-sensitive. Syntax is also not always consistent across packages.
    + An embarrassing number of errors I receive is because of a typo. This is always a good first check.

* Functions are always formatted as such:
    + function (argument1, argument2)
    + The function name always goes first and the arguments follow, separated by commas and enclosed in parentheses.
    + We'll see lots of examples!

* When your console returns '+' it means the function is still open. You probably forgot a close parentheses. 

* ?function or help(function) are your best friends in RStudio.

* Search engines and StackOverflow are your best friends outside of RStudio.

* There can be many different approaches to solving a single problem. 

* This is a learned skill and it's not always easy.

#Let's dive into the data!
First we need to get the data into R.
